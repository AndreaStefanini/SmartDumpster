this is the repository for the third assignment of the course Embedded System and IoT:
the assignment requires a "three way" communication system, an Android device through internet protocol communicates with a rest server in order to obtain a token; said token will be then sent to an Arduino, hooked up to a Bluetooth module. The Arduino system will the contact the rest server himself, thank to the ESP8266, to confirm that the token is valid token (although this part was not required), in case of a positive response the Arduino will inform the user that he is allowed to thow the garbage inside the bin. In addition to the "user function", the Arduino/ESP8266 will also provide ADMIN related function (DO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE CHOISE OF THE TYPE OF TECNOLOGY USED IS HEAVILY RELATED TO THE CONTEXT OF THE PROJECT, A UNIVERSITY PROJECT TO BE PRECISE). the above-mentioned fuction can be found in webserver function, offered by the ESP8266, that will allow the admin, though a website interface, to check the state of the bin (empty, full, of the number of trash inside) and empty the trashcan in case it is full.
